### Lab 12.1: Creating a New PDB from the PDB Seed

#### Objective:
To create a pluggable database (PDB) from the PDB seed in `CDBLAB` using SQL*Plus. The new PDB will be named `PDB3` and will have the following characteristics:
- Users `SYS` and `SYSTEM` will have the same password as in `CDBLAB`.
- The DBA user for the PDB is `pdb3_admin` with the same password as `SYS` and `SYSTEM`.
- The PDB datafiles will be located in the `/u01/app/oracle/oradata/` directory.

#### Assumptions:
- The `CDBLAB` database instance and listener have been started.

### Steps:

1. **Open a Terminal and Set the Environment Variables for `CDBLAB`**

   Open a terminal and set the environment variables for the `CDBLAB` database:
   ```sh
   . oraenv
   ORACLE_SID = [orclcdb] ? CDBLAB
   The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /u01/app/oracle
   ```

2. **Run the Script to Set Up TNS Names**

   Run the script to set up TNS names:
   ```sh
   /home/oracle/labs/DBMod_PDBs/setup_tns.sh
   The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /u01/app/oracle
   ```

3. **Create the New PDB**

   a. Log in to SQL*Plus and connect to the CDB root with a user with the `CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE` privilege:
   ```sh
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   ```

   b. Execute the `CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE` command:
   ```sql
   CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE PDB3
   ADMIN USER pdb3_admin IDENTIFIED BY password
   ROLES=(CONNECT)
   CREATE_FILE_DEST='/u01/app/oracle/oradata';
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Pluggable database created.
   ```

4. **Check the Status of the New PDB**

   ```sql
   column pdb_name format a16
   SELECT pdb_id, pdb_name, status FROM cdb_pdbs;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   PDB_ID PDB_NAME      STATUS
   ------ ------------- ----------
   2      PDB$SEED      NORMAL
   3      PDB1          NORMAL
   4      PDB2          NORMAL
   5      PDB3          NEW
   ```

5. **Open the New PDB and Check the Status Again**

   ```sql
   ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE PDB3 OPEN;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Pluggable database altered.
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT pdb_id, pdb_name, status FROM cdb_pdbs;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   PDB_ID PDB_NAME      STATUS
   ------ ------------- ----------
   2      PDB$SEED      NORMAL
   3      PDB1          NORMAL
   4      PDB2          NORMAL
   5      PDB3          NORMAL
   ```

   Exit SQL*Plus:
   ```sql
   exit
   ```

6. **Create a Net Service Name for the New PDB**

   a. Launch Oracle Net Manager:
   ```sh
   netmgr
   ```

   **In Oracle Net Manager:**
   - Expand `Local` and select `Service Naming`.
   - Click the plus sign to add a new service.
   - Enter `Net Service Name: PDB3` and click `Next`.
   - Select `TCP/IP (Internet Protocol)` and click `Next`.
   - Enter `Host Name: localhost`, verify the `Port Number` is `1521`, and click `Next`.
   - Enter `Service Name: PDB3`.
   - For `Connection Type`, select `Dedicated Server` and click `Next`.
   - Click `Finish`.
   - Click `File > Save Network Configuration`.
   - Click `File > Exit`.

7. **Connect to the PDB and Verify the Datafiles**

   Connect to the new PDB using SQL*Plus:
   ```sh
   sqlplus system@PDB3
   Enter password: password
   ```

   Verify the datafiles are in the correct location:
   ```sql
   SELECT name FROM v$datafile;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   NAME
   ----------------------------------------
   /u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBLAB/<unique_id>/datafile/o1_mf_system_<unique_id>.dbf
   /u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBLAB/<unique_id>/datafile/o1_mf_sysaux_<unique_id>.dbf
   /u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBLAB/<unique_id>/datafile/o1_mf_undotbs1_<unique_id>.dbf
   ```

8. **Verify the Service**

   Verify that the service is `PDB3`:
   ```sql
   column name format a15
   SELECT name FROM v$services;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   NAME
   ---------------
   PDB3
   ```

   Exit SQL*Plus:
   ```sql
   exit
   ```

9. **Exit the Terminal**

   ```sh
   exit
   ```

### Summary
In this lab, you created a new pluggable database (PDB) named `PDB3` from the PDB seed in `CDBLAB` using SQL*Plus. You configured the new PDB with specific characteristics, created a net service name for it, and verified its datafiles and service configuration. This practice ensures you understand how to create and manage PDBs in an Oracle database environment.

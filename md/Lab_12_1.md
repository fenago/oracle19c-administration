### Lab 12.1: Creating a New PDB from the PDB Seed

#### Objective
To create a pluggable database (PDB) from the PDB seed in a newly created CDB using SQL*Plus. The new PDB will be named `PDB3` and will have the following characteristics:
- Users SYS and SYSTEM will have the same password as in the CDB.
- The DBA user for the PDB is `pdb3_admin` with the same password as SYS and SYSTEM.
- The PDB datafiles will be located in the `/u01/app/oracle/oradata/` directory.

#### Assumptions
The CDB and listener have been started.

#### Steps

### Part A: Creating a New CDB

1. **Create a New CDB**

   a. Open a terminal and set the environment variables:
   ```sh
   . oraenv
   ORACLE_SID = [orclcdb] ? NEWCDB
   The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /u01/app/oracle
   ```

   b. Run DBCA in silent mode to create the new CDB:
   ```sh
   dbca -silent -createDatabase \
   -templateName General_Purpose.dbc \
   -gdbName NEWCDB -sid NEWCDB \
   -createAsContainerDatabase true \
   -numberOfPDBs 0 \
   -responseFile NO_VALUE \
   -characterSet AL32UTF8 \
   -memoryMgmtType auto_sga \
   -totalMemory 2048 \
   -emConfiguration NONE \
   -datafileDestination '/u01/app/oracle/oradata' \
   -sysPassword fenago \
   -systemPassword fenago
   ```

   c. Verify the new CDB creation by connecting to it:
   ```sh
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   SQL> select con_id, name, open_mode from v$pdbs;
   ```

### Part B: Creating a New PDB from the PDB Seed

1. **Open a Terminal and Set the Environment Variables for NEWCDB**

   Open a terminal and set the environment variables for the `NEWCDB` database:
   ```sh
   . oraenv
   ORACLE_SID = [NEWCDB] ? NEWCDB
   The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /u01/app/oracle
   ```

2. **Create the New PDB**

   a. Log in to SQL*Plus and connect to the CDB root with a user with the CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE privilege:
   ```sh
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   ```

   b. Execute the CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE command:
   ```sql
   CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE PDB3
   ADMIN USER pdb3_admin IDENTIFIED BY fenago
   ROLES=(CONNECT)
   CREATE_FILE_DEST='/u01/app/oracle/oradata';
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Pluggable database created.
   ```

3. **Check the Status of the New PDB**

   ```sql
   column pdb_name format a16
   SELECT pdb_id, pdb_name, status FROM cdb_pdbs;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   PDB_ID PDB_NAME      STATUS
   ------ ------------- ----------
   2      PDB$SEED      NORMAL
   3      PDB3          NEW
   ```

4. **Open the New PDB and Check the Status Again**

   ```sql
   ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE PDB3 OPEN;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Pluggable database altered.
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT pdb_id, pdb_name, status FROM cdb_pdbs;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   PDB_ID PDB_NAME      STATUS
   ------ ------------- ----------
   2      PDB$SEED      NORMAL
   3      PDB3          NORMAL
   ```

   Exit SQL*Plus:
   ```sql
   exit
   ```

5. **Create a Net Service Name for the New PDB**

   a. Launch Oracle Net Manager:
   ```sh
   netmgr
   ```

   b. In Oracle Net Manager:
   - Expand Local and select Service Naming.
   - Click the plus sign to add a new service.
   - Enter Net Service Name: `PDB3` and click Next.
   - Select TCP/IP (Internet Protocol) and click Next.
   - Enter Host Name: `localhost`, verify the Port Number is 1521, and click Next.
   - Enter Service Name: `PDB3`.
   - For Connection Type, select Dedicated Server and click Next.
   - Click Finish.
   - Click File > Save Network Configuration.
   - Click File > Exit.

6. **Connect to the PDB and Verify the Datafiles**

   a. Connect to the new PDB using SQL*Plus:
   ```sh
   sqlplus system@PDB3
   Enter password: fenago
   ```

   b. Verify the datafiles are in the correct location:
   ```sql
   SELECT name FROM v$datafile;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   NAME
   ----------------------------------------
   /u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBLAB/<unique_id>/datafile/o1_mf_system_<unique_id>.dbf
   /u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBLAB/<unique_id>/datafile/o1_mf_sysaux_<unique_id>.dbf
   /u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBLAB/<unique_id>/datafile/o1_mf_undotbs1_<unique_id>.dbf
   ```

7. **Verify the Service**

   Verify that the service is `PDB3`:
   ```sql
   column name format a15
   SELECT name FROM v$services;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   NAME
   ---------------
   PDB3
   ```

   Exit SQL*Plus:
   ```sql
   exit
   ```

8. **Exit the Terminal**

   ```sh
   exit
   ```

#### Summary
In this lab, you created a new pluggable database (PDB) named `PDB3` from the PDB seed in `CDBLAB` using SQL*Plus. You configured the new PDB with specific characteristics, created a net service name for it, and verified its datafiles and service configuration. This practice ensures you understand how to create and manage PDBs in an Oracle database environment.

### Lab 13: Moving PDBs

#### Overview
In this lab, you will create a new CDB named `CDBDEV` and several PDBs, then practice moving a PDB from `CDBLAB` to `CDBTEST` using the near-zero downtime PDB relocation feature.

### Part A: Creating the New CDB and PDBs

1. **Create the New CDB (`CDBDEV`)**

   a. Open a terminal window and set the environment variables for `CDBLAB`:
   ```sh
   . oraenv
   ORACLE_SID = [orclcdb] ? CDBLAB
   The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /u01/app/oracle
   ```

   b. Start SQL*Plus and log in as a user with SYSDBA privileges:
   ```sh
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   ```

   c. Create the new CDB `CDBDEV`:
   ```sql
   CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE cdbdev
   ADMIN USER pdb_admin IDENTIFIED BY password
   FILE_NAME_CONVERT = ('/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBLAB/pdbseed', '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBDEV');
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Pluggable database created.
   ```

2. **Create PDBs in `CDBDEV`**

   a. Open a terminal window and set the environment variables for `CDBDEV`:
   ```sh
   . oraenv
   ORACLE_SID = [orclcdb] ? CDBDEV
   The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /u01/app/oracle
   ```

   b. Start SQL*Plus and log in as a user with SYSDBA privileges:
   ```sh
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   ```

   c. Create PDBs `PDB1`, `PDB2`, and `PDB3`:
   ```sql
   CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb1 FROM pdb$seed
   ADMIN USER pdb1_admin IDENTIFIED BY password
   FILE_NAME_CONVERT = ('/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBDEV/pdbseed', '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBDEV/pdb1');

   CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb2 FROM pdb$seed
   ADMIN USER pdb2_admin IDENTIFIED BY password
   FILE_NAME_CONVERT = ('/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBDEV/pdbseed', '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBDEV/pdb2');

   CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb3 FROM pdb$seed
   ADMIN USER pdb3_admin IDENTIFIED BY password
   FILE_NAME_CONVERT = ('/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBDEV/pdbseed', '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBDEV/pdb3');
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Pluggable database created.
   ```

   d. Open the PDBs:
   ```sql
   ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb1 OPEN;
   ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb2 OPEN;
   ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb3 OPEN;
   ```

### Part B: Moving a PDB

1. **Prepare for PDB Relocation**

   a. Open a terminal window and set the environment variables for `CDBLAB`:
   ```sh
   . oraenv
   ORACLE_SID = [orclcdb] ? CDBLAB
   The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /u01/app/oracle
   ```

   b. Start SQL*Plus and log in as a user with SYSDBA privileges:
   ```sh
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   ```

   c. Verify that the source (`CDBLAB`) is configured to use local undo:
   ```sql
   SET sqlprompt "CDBLAB1> "
   SELECT property_name, property_value
   FROM database_properties
   WHERE property_name = 'LOCAL_UNDO_ENABLED';
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   PROPERTY_NAME       PROPERTY_VALUE
   ------------------- ---------------
   LOCAL_UNDO_ENABLED  TRUE
   ```

2. **Verify the Test User and Table in `PDB3`**

   a. Connect to the `PDB3` service:
   ```sql
   connect test@pdb3
   Enter password: password
   ```

   b. Verify the test data:
   ```sql
   SELECT label, COUNT(*) FROM test.bigtab GROUP BY label;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   LABEL                        COUNT(*)
   ---------------------------- ----------
   DATA FROM test.bigtab        10000
   ```

3. **Prepare to Relocate `PDB3` from `CDBLAB` to `CDBTEST`**

   a. In `CDBLAB`, create the database link to access `CDBTEST`:
   ```sql
   connect / as sysdba
   DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK link_cdbtest;
   CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK link_cdbtest
   CONNECT TO system IDENTIFIED BY password
   USING 'CDBTEST';
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Database link created.
   ```

   b. List the PDBs to verify they are open:
   ```sql
   SHOW PDBS;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   CON_ID  CON_NAME   OPEN MODE  RESTRICTED
   ------  ---------- ---------- ----------
   2       PDB$SEED   READ ONLY  NO
   3       PDB1       READ WRITE NO
   4       PDB2       READ WRITE NO
   5       PDB3       READ WRITE NO
   ```

   c. If any of the PDBs are not open, open them:
   ```sql
   ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE ALL OPEN;
   ```

   d. Save the state of the PDBs:
   ```sql
   ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE ALL SAVE STATE;
   ```

4. **Create the Directory for `PDB3` in `CDBTEST`**

   a. Open a new terminal window and set the environment variables for `CDBTEST`:
   ```sh
   . oraenv
   ORACLE_SID = [orclcdb] ? CDBTEST
   The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /u01/app/oracle
   ```

   b. Create the directory for `PDB3`:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p /u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBTEST/pdb3
   ```

5. **Relocate `PDB3` from `CDBLAB` to `CDBTEST`**

   a. In `CDBTEST`, create the database link to access `PDB3` in `CDBLAB`:
   ```sql
   connect / as sysdba
   DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK link_orclcdb;
   CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK link_orclcdb
   CONNECT TO system IDENTIFIED BY password
   USING 'CDBLAB';
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Database link created.
   ```

   b. Relocate `PDB3` from `CDBLAB` to `CDBTEST`:
   ```sql
   CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb3
   FROM pdb3@link_orclcdb relocate
   FILE_NAME_CONVERT=('/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBLAB/pdb3', '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/CDBTEST/pdb3');
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Pluggable database created.
   ```

6. **Open the Relocated `PDB3` in Read-Only Mode**

   a. Open the relocated `PDB3` in read-only mode:
   ```sql
   ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb3 OPEN READ ONLY;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Pluggable database altered.
   ```

   b. Set the session to the relocated `PDB3` and verify the data:
   ```sql
   ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER=pdb3;
   SELECT label, COUNT(*) FROM test.bigtab GROUP BY label;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   LABEL                        COUNT(*)
   ---------------------------- ----------
   DATA FROM test.bigtab        10000
   ```

7. **Verify and Finalize the Relocation**

   a. In `CDBLAB`, verify that `PDB3` does not exist anymore:
   ```sql
   SELECT pdb_name, status FROM cdb_pdbs;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   PDB_NAME      STATUS
   ------------- ----------
   PDB$SEED      NORMAL
   PDB1          NORMAL
   PDB2          NORMAL
   ```

   b. In `CDBTEST`, open `PDB3` in read-write mode:
   ```sql
   ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb3 OPEN READ WRITE;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Pluggable database altered.
   ```

8. **Clean Up**

   a. Drop the relocated `PDB3` in `CDBTEST`:
   ```sql
   ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER=CDB$ROOT;
   ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb3 CLOSE;
   DROP PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb3 INCLUDING DATAFILES;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Pluggable database dropped.
   ```

   b. In `CDBLAB`, revoke the `SYSOPER` privilege from

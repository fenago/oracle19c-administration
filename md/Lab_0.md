### Lab 0: Initial System and Oracle Database Version Check

#### Objective:
To verify the operating system and Oracle Database versions and understand the directory structure of the Oracle 19.3.0 DB environment.

#### Steps:

1. **Check the Operating System Version**

   Open the terminal and run the following command to display the Linux version information:
   ```sh
   uname -a
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   The output should look similar to this:
   ```
   Linux 08dc11008e0a 6.5.0-1023-azure #24~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jun 12 19:55:26 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
   ```

   For more detailed information, run:
   ```sh
   cat /etc/os-release
   ```

2. **Check the Oracle Database Version**

   To determine the Oracle Database version, you can run the following command:
     ```sh
   su - oracle
   ```
   then
   ```sh
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   ```
   
   Now you need to start up the database:
   ```sql
   STARTUP;
   ```

   ![](./images/e1.png)
   
   Once in the SQL*Plus environment, run:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM v$version;
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   The output should confirm that you are using Oracle Database 19.3.0.

4. **Explore the Oracle Directory Structure**

   Navigate to the Oracle installation directory and list the contents. Start by running:
   ```sh
   cd /u01/app/oracle/product/19.3.0
   ls -althr
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   The output should list the directories and files under the Oracle installation path. Example output from your provided images:
   ```
   drwxrwxr-x 1 oracle oinstall 4.0K Jun 20 2020 ..
   drwxrwxr-x 1 oracle oinstall 4.0K Jun 20 2020 dbhome_1
   ```

5. **Create a Directory Structure Diagram**

   Based on the directory listing, draw a diagram or create a structured list of the files and directories in the Oracle 19.3.0 environment.

   **Example Directory Structure:**
   ```
   /u01/app/oracle/product/19.3.0/
   └── dbhome_1/
       ├── bin/
       ├── config/
       ├── dbs/
       ├── include/
       ├── inventory/
       ├── javavm/
       ├── jdbc/
       ├── jlib/
       ├── lib/
       ├── network/
       ├── OPatch/
       ├── oracore/
       ├── perl/
       ├── plsql/
       ├── precomp/
       ├── racg/
       ├── rdbms/
       ├── relnotes/
       ├── slax/
       ├── sqlplus/
       ├── srvm/
       ├── suptools/
       ├── uc4/
       ├── ucp/
       └── xdk/
   ```

### Summary
By completing these steps, you will be able to verify the Linux operating system version and Oracle Database version, and understand the directory structure of their Oracle 19.3.0 installation. This foundational knowledge is critical for effective database administration.

To shut down the Oracle database instance, you can use the following commands:

1. **Switch to the Oracle User (if not already switched):**
   ```sh
   su - oracle
   ```

2. **Connect to SQL*Plus as SYSDBA:**
   ```sh
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   ```

3. **Shutdown the Database:**
   Once in SQL*Plus, issue the shutdown command:
   ```sql
   SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
   ```
   
   ![](./images/e2.png)

   This command will perform a clean shutdown of the Oracle database instance. If you want to force the shutdown without waiting for current operations to complete, you can use:
   ```sql
   SHUTDOWN ABORT;
   ```

   However, `SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE` is preferred for normal operations as it ensures a clean shutdown.

### Summary of Commands
```sh
su - oracle
sqlplus / as sysdba
SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
```

Yes, Oracle Database includes Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Express (EM Express), a web-based tool for managing Oracle databases. EM Express is lightweight and allows you to perform basic database administration tasks.

### Steps to Configure and Access EM Express

#### Step 1: Enable EM Express

1. **Ensure the Database Listener is Running**
   Make sure the listener is running. If not, start it:
   ```sh
   lsnrctl start
   ```

2. **Set the Port for EM Express**

   You can use the `DBMS_XDB_CONFIG.SETHTTPSPORT` procedure to set the HTTPS port for EM Express. Here, we'll set it to port `5500`:

   ```sh
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   
   SQL> STARTUP;
   SQL> EXEC DBMS_XDB_CONFIG.SETHTTPSPORT(5500);
   ```

   Verify that the port is set:
   ```sh
   SQL> SELECT DBMS_XDB_CONFIG.GETHTTPSPORT FROM DUAL;
   ```

#### Step 2: Access EM Express

1. **Open a Web Browser**

   Open your preferred web browser and enter the following URL:
   ```
   https://<hostname>:5500/em
   ```

   Replace `<hostname>` with the actual hostname or IP address of your database server. If you are running it on the same machine, you can use `localhost`.

![](./images/e4.png)

   You can click proceed and ignore the warning.

2. **Log In to EM Express**

   You will be prompted to log in. Use the credentials for a user with DBA privileges, such as `SYS` or `SYSTEM`.

   **Example:**
   ```
   Username: SYS
   Password: YourPassword
   ```

![](./images/e5.png)

   Ensure to select `AS SYSDBA` if you are logging in as the `SYS` user if option is available.

### Step 3: Managing Your Database with EM Express

Once logged in, you can perform various database management tasks, including:
- Monitoring database performance
- Managing users and security
- Configuring storage structures
- Managing database instances and services
